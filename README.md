# Refactor Starter Code

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to refactor an existing site to implement accessibility standards so it is optimized for search engines. This was accomplished by adding alt text to all img tags. I also re-organized the CSS and HTML to make it more efficient by consolidating selectors and properties, and for improved readability, I added comments before and after each element and section.

## User Story
AS A marketing agency  
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards  
* WHEN I view the source code, THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements, THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements, THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes, THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element, THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
